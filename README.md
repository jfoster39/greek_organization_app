greek_organization_app
======================

Senior Design Project

Here you will find all attached files for the project. Currently, it is only running php, js, and basic html/css styles. 

In order to view the page you need to use a local server such as apache to host the page. For macs, MAMP is a very easy option. 
Linux and windows will both have their own ways to host, but as long as you go with a basic lamp stack for the moment it should 
be fine. 

Also there has not been any backend support added, this is currently just a front end mockup of the site. 

Below are sample screenshots of the app
